# ChessDeepLearning

Project initiated by PUCHELLE Justin and SOUBRAND Florentin

The goal of this project is to build a chess game with an AI
driven by deep-learning.

The lists of respected rules can be found in the rules.txt file.

(feb 2019) We think about making a clean interface with sdl or gtk.
           The first goal that we fixed is to make a simple game chess
           for 2 players.
           With accessible cells colored when piece is choosen
           We think about making a matrix holding int
           int representing pieces : like the 1st bit for the piece 
           and the 2nd for the team.

(jul 2019) Long time after : After reading the code we think about making it 
           clean and undertandable
           After cleaning it and putting ssome comments, we realize that we 
           should check before moving if ennemy team could kill the king after 
           the move. And not just between every turn as we thought.
