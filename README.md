# ChessDeepLearning

Project initiated by PUCHELLE Justin and SOUBRAND Florentin

The goal of this project is to build a chess game with an AI
driven by deep-learning.

The lists of respected rules can be found in the rules.txt file.

1st day : We think about making a clean interface with sdl or gtk.
          The first goal that we fixed is to make a simple game chess
          for 2 players.
          With accessible cells colored when piece is choosen
          We think about making a matrix holding int
          int representing pieces : like the 1st bit for the piece 
          and the 2nd for the team.
